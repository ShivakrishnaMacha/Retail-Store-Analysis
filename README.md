# Retail Store Financial Analysis

## Problem Statement
The business needs a comprehensive financial analysis to better understand its sales performance, profitability, and discount trends. The goal is to evaluate the current financial health of the company by comparing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, profit, and orders between the current year and the previous year. Additionally, the business wants to identify areas for improvement, particularly focusing on profit margins and the impact of discount strategies.

As a data analyst, I followed the below steps to provide actionable insights into the company's financial performance, helping stakeholders make informed strategic decisions.

The dashboard showcases multiple key performance indicators (KPIs), including Sales, Orders, Profit, Profit Margin, and Discount, each comparing the current year’s performance against the previous year. Notably, it reveals significant growth in sales (+249.46%), orders (+255.36%), and profit (+235.58%), though the profit margin saw a slight decrease (-3.97%). These KPIs give stakeholders a quick overview of the business's financial health and areas for improvement.

## Steps Followed & Learning From This Project

1. Explored the sample dataset to understand key financial metrics such as sales, orders, profit, profit margin, and discount.
2. Connected the dataset to Power BI and performed necessary data cleaning, addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
3. Created a Date Table using DAX for time-based analysis and built a star schema model linking the sales, order, and financial data.
4. Calculated key KPIs using DAX, such as Sales, Orders, Profit, Profit Margin, and Discount, along with year-over-year comparisons.
5. Compared the current year’s performance against the previous year to identify growth trends and areas for improvement.
6. Designed an interactive dashboard with visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and cards to display KPIs and growth trends.
7. Added slicers for dynamic filtering by various financial dimensions (e.g., region, category).
8. Presented findings highlighting significant growth in sales, orders, and profit but a slight decrease in profit margin.
9. Offered actionable insights for strategic decisions, such as optimizing profit margins and leveraging sales growth.
10. Created a concise report summarizing key findings and providing recommendations for improving profitability.

## Final Result
The final result was an interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing year-over-year comparisons of key financial metrics. The dashboard provided clear insights into the business's performance, highlighting growth in sales and orders, and identifying areas to improve profit margins.
